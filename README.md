# Market Predictor

## Overview

The `market_predictor` project is an upcoming machine learning initiative designed to predict the products a customer is likely to purchase based on their preferences and attributes. This tool will utilize machine learning algorithms from the `scikit-learn` library to build and evaluate predictive models, offering insights into customer behavior.

## Features (Planned)

- **Predictive Analysis**: Apply machine learning techniques to forecast customer product preferences.
- **Scikit-learn Integration**: Leverage various algorithms from the `scikit-learn` library.
- **Data Processing**: Implement data preprocessing to ensure accurate and reliable modeling.
- **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**: A user-friendly GUI will be developed to facilitate interaction with the predictive models, making it easier to input data, run predictions, and view results.

## Roadmap

1. **Data Preparation**: Develop preprocessing pipelines to handle and clean customer data.
2. **Model Development**: Build and train multiple machine learning models using `scikit-learn`.
3. **Evaluation and Tuning**: Evaluate model performance and optimize algorithms for better accuracy.
4. **GUI Development**: Create a graphical user interface for an intuitive user experience.
5. **Deployment**: Finalize deployment scripts and tools for practical use.
